# Project (b1h2b)

To run with GUI, you must clone this repository to a local location and install the Node dependencies:

```shell script
cd lib/gui
npm install
```

And then you can run the GUI with `ui.GUI.main()`

To run just the GUI, use:

```shell script
cd lib/gui
electron .
```

To run without GUI, use `ui.Main.main()`
